Welcome,
my name is Lars and this is my digital garden about the [[Zune HD|Zune]]!

Here I will be sharing all the information I find about the Zune. I will mostly talk about its hardware / firmware and how to develop applications for it more than 20 years after it was first published. Most of the information will revolve around the **[[Zune HD]]** as it has the best hardware and is less secure than the older models. 

## Topics
- [[Zune HD]]
- [[Official Documentation]]
- [[Open ZDK]]
- [[OpenGL ES]]
- [[Windows CE 6.0]]
- [[File Types]]
