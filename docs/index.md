Welcome! 

This is my little digital garden where I will be sharing all the information I find about the Zune. Here I will mostly talk about it's hardware / firmware and how to develop applications for it more than 20 years after it was first published.  
Most of the information here will revolve around the **Zune HD** as it has the best hardware and is less secure than the older models.
